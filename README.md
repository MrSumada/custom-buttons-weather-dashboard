## How to Use

* Just type your city into the text input field, and hit "Search".  Next you'll be seeing that city's temperature, humidity, 5-day Forecast, and more!

* If you search for your city for the first time, a custom button will be generated and stored. That way you can easily look up that same city the next time you visit your dashboard!

* Store up to 10 cities! Make this Dashboard your own!
